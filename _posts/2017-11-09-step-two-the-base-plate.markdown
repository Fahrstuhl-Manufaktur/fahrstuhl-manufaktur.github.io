Now that we have the chair, we need something to attach the engine, wheels and basically everything else to. We got ourselves some phenol faced plywood, which should be robust enough for this project.

To attach the other parts to the base plate we will be using [externally-threaded insert nuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insert_nut), so that we can safely remove them without wearing out the board.
In the next step we will aquire the remaining parts to get the plate to roll.
