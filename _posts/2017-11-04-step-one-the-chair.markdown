Ok, let's start.

First thing we need to get is a chair as a base.
One requirement we had was transportability.
It should be easy to dismantle, put in a case or something, and can be taken on a train or other public transport.
This is the one we have choosen:

It basically consists of 3 parts:

- The base
- Backpanel
- Left/right armrest

So it is very easy to take apart, and put back together when needed.
